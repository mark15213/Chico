# @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-layout

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Shell plugin: three-column AppFrame (drag handles and concession chain) plus the `ctx.layout` panel-geometry service; it registers into the runtime-owned `root` slot and declares `sidebar`, `conversation`, `details`, and `conversation.empty`. The sidebar resize boundary is an invisible hit strip, while the details boundary retains its floating pill; only details shrinks during concession and then auto-closes. A closed sidebar retains a 56px control rail while details closes to zero width. The package also seats the theme presenter: it consumes resolved `ctx.theme` snapshots and projects them onto the document (`html { color-scheme }` for native UA chrome, `body[data-ds-dark-theme]` from the active color scheme, the theme's alias tokens as inline variables on body, and one owned `<meta name="theme-color">` whose content follows the computed body background). Measuring after palette and token application keeps the rendered background as the single color authority; disposing the presenter removes its metadata node with its other global writes.

AppFrame always mounts the conversation and details columns; a connected Session renders through `SessionProvider`. The transient layout store starts the sidebar at its default width and details closed, and it never reads or writes `localStorage`. Hero and other unselected states also derive a zero rendered details width without changing that stored preference. AppFrame retains the last non-blank Session id across those states: the first Session remains closed, an explicit details action opens the contract default width, returning to the same Session restores its unchanged width, and selecting a different Session closes details before paint. The sidebar owner share carries `mode` and `setMode` beside `collapsed` and `width`; the conversation and details owner shares carry `mode`. Registrants obtain business data from standard hooks and actions from their own inject faces.

`mode` is which frame the columns show. All three columns read it — the sidebar's region and the details column swap occupant with it, and the centre column's occupant swaps its blank-conversation opening — so it belongs to the frame rather than to any one column: a switch that moved one column would leave the others describing something else. `sessions` is the harness's own frame, and a composition that registers no other draws no switch. Switching frames closes the details panel, because its occupant changes with the mode and leaving it open would swap a panel's contents under a reader.

The session gate on the details column belongs to the default frame alone. The harness's own detail is a call inside one conversation, so it is gated on a live non-blank one and closes on a session switch; another frame's detail is about whatever that frame put in focus, which can outlive every session and exist before the first one opens.

The `/client` exports are the plugin body (`apply`/`inject`), `LayoutController`, and the four owner-share interfaces. AppFrame, the panel store, and the concession solver remain package-internal.

## Model Experience

None, as the layout shell manages browser viewing state; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Panel geometry is transient** — reload restores the sidebar default and details closed; switching between distinct Session ids also closes details and forgets its dragged width, while unselected surfaces render details at zero width without modifying geometry.
- **Concession-chain auto-close derives a zero width without touching the preferred width** — the panel restores itself when the window widens; consumers must not read the stored details width as the rendered truth.
- **No scroll anchoring during squeeze reflow** — layout changes may move the reader's viewport.
